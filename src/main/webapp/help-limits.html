Simulation name field describes what gatling simulation given limits are linked to.<br>
Max failed descibes how many failed request are acceptable before failing build<br>
Mean number of responses per second describes how many responses need to come on average per second<br>
Max response time describes how long longest reqest can take (time from request to response)<br>
